	<h1>Hello I am an integrated art director and writer and I will spare you the pain of another bio written in the third person.</h1>
	<p>I've worked in London, Sydney and for almost a decade in NYC. Sports, phones, cars, banks, planes, booze, the lot. Spent time at M&C Saatchi, Y&R, R/GA, Brooklyn Brothers, McGarryBowen, Ogilvy and more. Solved problems across all platforms and won a lot of business along the way. I've been recognised at Cannes, D&AD, OneShow, AICP, had my work screened at Sundance and I'm in the permanent archive at MoMA, but can never seem to find it. I also teach the senior advertising class at the Pratt Institute and when I'm not blah blah blahing, I'm blah blahing.</p>
